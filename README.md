Analysis
In this module, we were given data of a company and were asked to analyze it to determine how many employees are in the company and how many will be retiring soon. The data that helped us analyze what we want to find out were employees' information ranging from title and salary, to how long the employee has been working at the company.

Results
-By the end of determining how many employees will be retiring in total, there would be about 90,000 that would retire. The title that has the most retiring are Senior Engineers with almost 30,000 retiring and the title with the least retiring with two people are managers.
-Given the data, we organized the different titles from each department, and there were a total of seven that includes Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technical Leader, Assistant Engineer and Manager
-Those who are up for mentorship eligibility are those who are mostly either engineers or senior engineers, and staff and technique leaders. The total count for employees up for the mentorship is 1549.

Summary
In addition to the queries we created, we could create another one that would identify any young adult employees and how long they have been at the company. Once we figure that out, we can determine if any of the employees are up for any promotion or raise. Overall, there are many ways we can look at this data and analyze much more from what we were given.
